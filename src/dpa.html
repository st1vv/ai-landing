                instructions regarding ScroogeFrog’s processing of Personal Data

                ScroogeFrog may be unable to assess whether the Customer’s
                Instructions violate any of the Applicable Data Protection Laws.
                However, should ScroogeFrog form such an opinion, it will
                immediately notify the Customer, who may then choose to withdraw
                or modify the Customer’s Instructions.

                law. If a legal requirement mandates that ScroogeFrog process or
                disclose the Personal Data, ScroogeFrog must first inform the
                Customer of this requirement, allowing the Customer an
                opportunity to object or challenge it, unless prohibited by law
